# Architecture

System Lab is one Vite + React application with internal boundaries. The site documents the
design system and is built from it. This file explains the layers, the token tiers, how props map
to tokens, and where state lives. The Overview page shows the same material with live data.

## Layers

| Folder | Layer | Responsibility | May import |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/design-system/tokens` | ds-tokens | DTCG sources, generated CSS variables, TypeScript keys, manifest, prop vocabularies | — |
| `src/design-system/styles` | ds-styles | Cascade layer order, reset, base element styles | ds-tokens |
| `src/design-system/layout` | ds-layout | Box, Stack, Inline, Grid, Container | ds-tokens |
| `src/design-system/primitives` | ds-primitives | Text, Heading, Button, Badge, Icon, Link, Input, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Progress, Skeleton, VisuallyHidden | ds-tokens, ds-layout |
| `src/design-system/composites` | ds-composites | Card, Dialog, Alert, Tabs, Field, PageHeader, EmptyState | ds-tokens, ds-layout, ds-primitives |
| `src/domain/system` | domain | The catalog of components, foundations and patterns; the changelog; catalog-aware presentation | design system |
| `src/features/docs` | feature | Component reference rendering, live examples, source viewers, token chains | design system, domain |
| `src/features/directory` | feature | Search and filter logic, URL encoding, the filter UI | design system, domain |
| `src/features/scenarios` | feature | Demo scenarios, simulated requests, the `useRequest` state machine | design system, domain |
| `src/features/playground` | feature | Typed control specs, prop and snippet builders, the workbench UI | design system, domain |
| `src/content/*` | content | Overview, foundations, component docs and stories, pattern demos and fixtures | design system, domain, features |
| `src/app` | app | Shell, routes, providers, pages | everything |
| `src/main.tsx` | entry | Mounts the app and global styles | app, ds-styles |
| `src/test` | test-support | Test setup and cross-layer tests | everything |

## Rules enforced by `npm run lint:architecture`

`scripts/architecture/check-boundaries.mjs` parses every import in `src/` with the TypeScript
scanner, resolves it to a file and fails on: **layer** (importing a layer not allowed above),
**sibling-module** (one feature or content area importing another), **public-entry** (reaching
past another module's `index.ts`), **own-public-entry**, **forbidden-package** (`react-router`
inside the design system or domain), **cycle** and **unresolved**. `?raw` imports are exempt.

`scripts/architecture/check-styles.mjs` requires every CSS Module to declare its cascade layer,
forbids raw colors and palette (`--color-*`) variables outside the token files, and requires every
`var(--name)` to be a generated token, declared in the same file, or a private `--_name`.

## Token tiers

1. **Reference** (`reference.tokens.json`): palettes and raw scales — `color.blue.600`,
   `space.md`, `radius.lg`, `shadow.medium`, `duration.base`. Nothing outside the token files
   reads them.
2. **Semantic** (`semantic.tokens.json`, `theme.light|dark.tokens.json`): purpose-named aliases —
   `surface.panel`, `text.muted`, `border.default`, `action.primary.background`,
   `tone.danger.text`, `focus.ring`, `spacing.medium`, `elevation.low`. Themes remap the color
   and elevation roles; everything else is shared.
3. **Component** (`component.tokens.json`): decisions for one component that alias semantic
   tokens — `button.primary.background-hover`, `badge.radius`, `card.padding`,
   `dialog.width.medium`, `switch.track-on`, `skeleton.size.large`. Added only where a component
   exposes a knob a product may retune.

The pipeline keeps aliases as `var()` in CSS, so changing `data-theme` on any element cascades
through all three tiers. Contrast for every foreground/background pair is unit-tested in both
themes (`contrast.test.ts`, 170 checks).

## From prop to style

Props accept named choices only. `src/design-system/tokens/vocabulary.ts` maps shared vocabularies
to token paths:

| Vocabulary | Values | Tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space (`gap`, `rowGap`, `columnGap`, `padding`) | none, extraSmall, small, medium, large, extraLarge, extraExtraLarge | `spacing.*` |
| Radius | none, small, medium, large, extraLarge, full | `radius.*` |
| Elevation | none, low, medium, high | `elevation.*` |
| Border strength (surfaces) | none, subtle, default, strong | `border.*` at `border-width.thin` |
| Surface | canvas, panel, sunken, accent | `surface.*` |
| Tone | neutral, brand, success, warning, danger, info | `tone.<tone>.{text,surface,border,solid,on-solid}` |
| Column width | extraSmall, small, medium, large | `size.item.*` |

Components set private `--_` custom properties from these values; their CSS reads the private
property with the component token as fallback, for example
`background-color: var(--_background, var(--card-background))`. That is the documented precedence:
an explicit prop wins, an unset prop uses the component token. Example trace:
`appearance="primary"` → `--button-primary-background` → `--action-primary-background` →
`--color-blue-600` (light) / `--color-blue-300` (dark).

Option arrays (`buttonAppearances`, `badgeSizes`, `gridColumnCounts` …) and default objects are
exported next to each component. The component, its docs and its playground story all import the
same arrays, and `src/test/playground.test.tsx` checks they stay identical.

## Grid modes

`Grid` derives one of three modes, so no prop combination is ambiguous: `columns` alone is fixed;
`minColumnWidth` alone (or neither) is responsive auto-fit; both is auto-fit capped at `columns`.
`rowGap` and `columnGap` override `gap` per axis.

## Cascade layers

`@layer reset, tokens, base, layout, components, product;` — a later layer always wins regardless
of specificity or load order, so product code can adjust a component with a plain class.

## Responsive strategy

- Intrinsic layout first: Inline wraps, Grid auto-fits.
- Container queries for components and compositions (EntryCard 28rem, ActivityList 36rem,
  DirectoryFilters 40rem, the playground workbench 52rem, documentation pages 56rem).
- One viewport media query, in the app shell, for the section sidebar at 64rem.

## State ownership

| State | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Local UI (disclosures, selected tab, pins in demos) | The component (`useState`) or the native element |
| Components index filters | URL search parameters (`useUrlDirectoryFilters`) |
| Playground component | URL `?component=`; control values, preview theme and width in `Playground` state |
| Demo scenario and resets | `ScenarioDemo`, which remounts the demo with a `key` |
| Simulated requests | `useRequest` (discriminated union, abort on reload, stale-response guard) |
| Theme preference | `ThemeProvider` (app layer), stored in localStorage |
| Counts, filtered lists, snippets | Derived during render |

No design-system component knows about fixtures, scenarios or the playground.

## Routing and focus

Routes: `/`, `/foundations`, `/foundations/:topicId`, `/components`, `/components/:componentId`,
`/playground`, `/patterns`, `/patterns/:patternId` and a catch-all. All but the overview are lazy
chunks. `usePageTitle` sets `document.title` and moves focus to the page `h1` after client-side
navigation, or to the target of a URL fragment; first load and query changes leave focus alone.
`Link` renders a real anchor; the app passes React Router's `navigate` through `LinkProvider`.
