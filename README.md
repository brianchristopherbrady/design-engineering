# Design System Lab

Design System Lab is a design system and its reference site, created by
[Brian Brady](https://brianbrady.dev) to demonstrate design-system thinking and implementation
([case study](https://brianbrady.dev/projects/system-lab.html)). The site documents tokens, foundations,
components and patterns with live demos, and it is built entirely from the components it
documents: the navigation, the Components index and the pattern demos all read the same catalog.

Sections:

- **Overview** — who made it and why, a suggested review path, how the site is built from the
  system, principles and the layered architecture.
- **Foundations** — token tiers, color, typography, spacing, borders and radii, elevation, motion,
  themes and responsive rules, rendered from the generated token manifest. **Products and modes**
  shows one token source resolving into three products × two themes × two densities, with a mode
  composer, a computed product diff, nested scopes and density measurements; the **theme studio**
  generates a complete product from one brand color (OKLCH ramp with its gamut limits, contrast-
  chosen roles, shape, WCAG 2 and APCA checks, status and color-vision checks, shareable links and
  every source file to add); the responsive foundation lists every container and media query in the
  code.
- **Components** — each component's props, defaults, precedence rules, prop → token traces,
  examples, accessibility notes and real source.
- **Playground** — Storybook-style controls for real public props, presets, a scoped theme,
  product and density, an independently resizable preview, a query-container overlay and a usage
  snippet that always matches the controls.
- **Patterns** — a resource directory, a resource detail page, an activity dashboard and a
  validated form, with a **Demo scenario** selector for loading, empty, success, error and
  no-results states, and an overlay of the query containers each demo responds to.
- **Design decisions** — the reasoning behind a system: planning requirements and a pilot,
  what a consumer mobile product and a professional desktop application should share (with a
  comparison that responds to constraints), choosing an implementation approach, and operating
  and measuring a system. Hypothetical, proposed and conceptual material is labelled as such.

The header switches the whole site between products (Design System Lab, Harbor, Meadow), themes and
densities; nothing in a component knows which one is active.

## Run it

Requirements: Node 20.19 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

Other scripts:

```sh
npm run tokens       # regenerate CSS variables, TypeScript keys and the token manifest
npm run typecheck    # tsc -b (app and tooling)
npm run lint         # ESLint + token freshness + import boundaries + stylesheet rules
npm test             # Vitest unit and component tests
npm run build        # production build in dist/
npm run preview      # serve dist/
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright + axe-core against the production build
npm run verify       # all of the above
```

`npm run test:e2e` needs a Chromium browser: run `npx playwright install chromium` once, or set
`PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=msedge` (or `chrome`) to use an installed browser.

Imports only point down: `app → content → features → domain → design-system`. The rules are
enforced by `npm run lint`; see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
