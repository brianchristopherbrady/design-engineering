            Choose a brand color, an id and a shape. The studio builds a 12-step OKLCH ramp, gives each brand role the
            first step that passes WCAG 2 against this system’s real surfaces, checks the result against the status colors
            and simulated color vision, and writes every source file a new product needs. Choices are kept in the address,
            so a theme can be bookmarked or sent for review.

            Every step has a fixed OKLCH lightness, so the ramp looks evenly spaced whatever the hue. Chroma follows the
            brand color and is reduced only where sRGB cannot show it, which keeps hue and lightness exact.

            Real components in real theme scopes. Only the brand roles and corner radii change; surfaces, text and status
            colors come from the system. The last row shows the primary button’s rest, hover, pressed and focus colors,
            which an interactive preview can only show one at a time.

        <Note title="How roles are chosen">
          <p>
            Each role tries ramp steps in a fixed order of preference and takes the first that passes against the theme’s
            canvas, panel and sunken surfaces. A bright yellow brand therefore gets a darker strong step than a violet one.
            APCA Lc is shown for information: it is the WCAG 3 draft method and not a WCAG 2 requirement.

            A brand that resembles danger makes every primary action look destructive, and one that resembles success
            blurs confirmation. The studio measures the distance between the brand’s strong fill and each status fill in
            OKLab, with typical vision and with simulated protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia.

            Add the pieces, then run <code>npm run tokens</code> and <code>npm test</code>. The pipeline generates the
            product’s CSS, types and manifest, and the contrast suite covers it in both themes without a test change. The
            full sequence is in <Link href="/foundations/products#adding">Adding a product</Link>.

            <li>Lightness is fixed per step in OKLCH; chroma is reduced only as far as sRGB requires, keeping hue and lightness.</li>
            <li>Roles are chosen by contrast, not by step number, and every choice is listed with its checks.</li>
            <li>WCAG 2 ratios decide pass or fail. APCA Lc values are shown for comparison and treat polarity differently.</li>

              Color-vision simulation uses the Machado, Oliveira and Fernandes (2009) model at full severity. It is an
              approximation; perception varies between people, and anomalous trichromacy is milder.
            </li>
            <li>
              The status distance threshold of 0.1 ΔEOK is a review heuristic, not a standard. In this system status is
              never conveyed by color alone, so a close pair is a design warning rather than a WCAG failure.

              The preview re-points one existing product’s brand roles and radii inline on a ThemeScope. Shipping still goes
              through the token files and the pipeline.
